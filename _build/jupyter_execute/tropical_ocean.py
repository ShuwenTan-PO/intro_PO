# # Tropical Oceans and Indonesian Throughflow

# > The physical scientist does not see
# the ocean primarily as a source of
# wealth or as a jumble of geographic
# curiosities. He sees it as a hydrodynamic
# phenomenon: larger than his
# laboratory, smaller than a star. To
# fathom its behavior, he needs detailed
# data on the velocity field in the ocean,
# from the microscales of mixing processes
# within the thermocline up to
# scales as large as the gyres of the general
# circulation. <div style="text-align: right"> â€” Henry Stommel, 1970 </div>
