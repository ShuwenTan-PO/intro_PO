    "<!-- From Wikipedia, the word \"[hydraulics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulics)\" originates from the Greek word: ὑδραυλικός (hydraulikos), with its first part ὕδωρ (hydor) meaning water and the second part αὐλός (aulos) meaning pipe. It somewhat speaks the essence of hydraulics, which requires a moving fluid (through a pipe, over a dam, etc.) and thus is different from hydrostatics. When a fluid moves, especailly over topography, transformation may occur between kinetic energy and potential energy (may also between interal energy/heat when friction/viscosity is involved), which renders rich and exciting physical phenomena. In this lecture, we will discuss two classic hydraulic phenomena: **hydraulic control** and **hydraulic jump**.\n",

The jump is at the transition between the point where the circle appears still and where the turbulence is visible. \n",

    "**Thought experiment (think first):** <br /> Suppose that the reservoir is fed by river runoff and drained at the same rate by the discharge over the dam. The whole system is in a steady state. Now somehow the elevation of the dam crest is raised. How would the system adjust to the change of topography?\n",
    "\n",
    "> If the elevation of the dam crest is raised, the height of the reservoir surface above the dam is diminished and the volume outflow decreases. The river runoff now exceeds the outflow and the excess is stored in the reservoir. The reservoir level rises and eventually the original outflow rate is restored. The actual sequence of events may be a little more complicated than what we have described, but the result is essentially correct: the dam influences the time history of the discharge. <div style=\"text-align: right\"> - Introduction, [Pratt and Whithead (2008)](https://www2.whoi.edu/staff/lpratt/textbook-on-rotating-hydraulics/) </div>\n",
