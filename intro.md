# Welcome to my guest lectures on EESCGU4925

Hi internet surfers, this is an online book that contains notes for my three guest lectures on Columbia University's 2022 fall course EESCGU4925, *intro to Physical Oceanography*. I hope to experiment traditional teaching methods: given class notes before the class started. But different from those class notes on paper, this online book contains moving pictures, links you can click on, and codes you can run. I look forward to giving more guest lectures on different topics and update this book with more materials and resorces frequently.
