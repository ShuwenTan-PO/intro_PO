# Welcome to my guest lectures on EESCGU4925

Hi internet surfers, this is an online book that contains notes for my three guest lectures on Columbia University's 2022 fall course EESCGU4925, *intro to Physical Oceanography*. It's a true privilege to give guest lectures at Columbia University and I wanted to take this opportunity to explore my teaching style and start developing my teaching philosophy. But first I want to test out this online book as my teaching medium. I hope I have included enough narratives that can walk you through the three topics. You can click on all pictures to enlarge them. You can play videos, but make sure you're connected to the internet. And hopefully everything is well cited and has links that can direct you to the resources. At the end of each lecture, I list resources that I absolutely love, including books, websites, lectures, etc. I hope to add executable code or interactive pictures to the book for you to better understand equations. I look forward to giving more guest lectures on different topics and updating this book with more materials and resources frequently. 

Finally, thank you so much for letting me teach!
