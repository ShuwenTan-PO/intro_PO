# > When you can measure what you are speaking about and express it in numbers,
# then you know something about it. \
# â€” Lord Kelvin, 1883

# ## Tale 1: We didn't see it coming.
# > The un-noticed 1982 El Ni$\tilde{n}$o

# 

# ## Tale 2: It's coming! Oops, false alarm.
# > The failed 2014 El Ni$\tilde{n}$o and the different 2015 Ni$\tilde{n}$o
